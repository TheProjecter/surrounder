This plugin uses private classes of IntelliJ IDEA not in the OpenAPI.
To use it, you must add the jar "idea.jar" in your IntelliJ IDEA application as a library of the project.

If the jar "idea.jar" is deployed to IDEA, then the plugin won't works.
To solve this problem just create a empty "idea.jar" read-only file into "IDEA_CONF_HOME/system/plugins-sandbox/surrounder/lib".
